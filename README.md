> ℹ️  **February 2021 update:** the collection sources were moved to a [Postman Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers). This makes it easier to install, update and contribute to the collection.<br/>
This repository is now dedicated to hosting the setup/contribution documentation and tracking issues.

## Installation

You can use the **Postman desktop app** or the **Postman web UI** to connect to Marketing Cloud with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud APIs collection. 

- [Install the Collection](install-the-collection.md)

Regardless of whether you choose the desktop app or the web UI, the installation steps are identical and you can use all of the collection’s requests and your changes are synchronized between the two environments so you can easily switch between them at any time.
