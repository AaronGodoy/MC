## Configure the Collection

The collection uses a series of collection variables to help streamline your calls. To successfully use the package it's important to be sure to update the collection variables.

1. Click **Salesforce Marketing Cloud APIs**
2. Open the **Variables** tab
3. Complete the following variables for your instance by placing the values in the **Current Value** column. Instructions for collecting these details can be found in the [Create an Installed Package in Marketing Cloud](#create-an-installed-package-in-marketing-cloud) section

|Variable|Example Value|Description|
|-|-|-|
|et_subdomain|28yte38jw4un5gkoky2w6|Tenant specific subdomain Authentication Base URI value. **Only include the subdomain.**|
|et_clientId|kx2xo6o2updxf2anwquyg|Client Id|
|et_clientSecret|gj38398t7g89nbqn58gtp|Client Secret|
|et_mid|14618743|MID of business unit|

4. Click **Save**.

## Collection Authentication

The collection has been configured to automatically request an access token based on if a token is present or expired. This is accomplished by using the collection variables defined in the [Configure the Collection](#configure-the-collection) section combined with a pre-request script. 

The script creates two new variables:
* dne_tokenRefreshTime 
* dne_etAccessToken 

The Marketing Cloud authorization tokens are valid for 20 minutes therefore when a token is requested we create a new variable called **dne_tokenRefreshTime** that stores the time the token was generated. Each subsequent call will use this refresh time to determine if a new token should be requested.

The token returned in the authorization call is stored as the collection variable **dne_etAccessToken**. For REST calls, this token is passed in the authorization header defined by a pre-request script at the REST folder level. For SOAP calls the token is passed in the body of the SOAP envelope.

## Execute a Request

1. Expand the collection and select the `Messaging & Journeys -> REST -> Address -> Validate Address` request
1. Click `Send`

At this point, if your environment is correctly set up, you should see a `200 OK` status. This means that you have successfully authenticated with Salesforce Marketing Cloud and that you can now use the other collection’s requests.

See [additional documentation](README.md#additional-documentation) for more information on how to keep the collection up to date and work with multiple Marketing Cloud instances.
